# tailwind-grid-inner

This Tailwind plugin is for creating CSS grids with "inner" borders only, meaning that each item in the grid gets a border on every side unless that side coincides with one of the four sides of the grid-container. If that's confusing, think of a tic-tac-toe grid. The mechanism results in grid-items of equal content-width, and it works fine with "unbalanced" grids (where there aren't enough items to fill the last row).

## Installation

First install the plugin from npm:

```bash
npm install @michaelallenwarner/tailwind-grid-inner
```

Then add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file. By default, this plugin uses the `:where()` pseudo-class, which [isn't supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where) in Safari 13 and some other older browsers. If that's fine for your use-case, then just do:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@michaelallenwarner/tailwind-grid-inner'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

If, however, you can't use `:where()`, then you can do this instead:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@michaelallenwarner/tailwind-grid-inner')({ target: 'legacy' }),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

(The `target: 'legacy'` option works just fine, but it generates more CSS and makes use of some selectors that have significantly higher specificity.)

## Usage

Use the `` `grid-inner-${n}` `` utilities to create inner-border-only grids with `n` equally sized columns. Supported values for `n` are the numbers 1â€“12, but you can also supply arbitrary values like `grid-inner-[n]` or `grid-inner-[n,m]`, where `n` is still the number of columns and where `m` is the desired border-width in pixels. Finally, there's `grid-inner-none`, which is for "canceling" the inner-grid layout altogether and is meant to be used with responsive variants (more on this [below](#the-none-value)).

```html
<div class="overflow-hidden"><!-- (if overflow is a problem; see notes below) -->
  <!-- grid-wrapper --> 
  <div class="grid-inner-1 sm:grid-inner-[2,4] md:grid-inner-3 lg:grid-inner-none border-red-500 border-solid">
    <!-- grid-items -->
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <!-- etc. -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Important Notes (Read This!)

- The grid-wrapper gets a bit of negative horizontal `margin`. If this results in overflow/scrollbars, simply wrap the grid-wrapper in an element that has `overflow: hidden`, like in the example above. (This probably won't be necessary unless the grid-wrapper stretches the full width of the screen.)
- Don't try to set `gap` on the grid-wrapper. Instead, achieve spacing by putting `padding` on (or in) the grid-items.
- Don't try to set `grid-column` on the grid-items (the Tailwind `col-span-` utilities).
- Don't try to set any `margin` or `border-width` on either the grid-wrapper or the grid-items.
- Don't try to use an `::after` pseudo-element on the grid-items.
- To control the color and style of the borders, put your `border-color` and `border-style` utility classes on the grid-wrapper rather than on its grid-item children. (The plugin gives the grid-items `border-color: inherit` and `border-style: inherit`.)
- The border-width must be an even integer, and the plugin will round (up) the supplied value if necessary. This is because there's no border-collapse mechanism for CSS Grid, and so the plugin gives each grid-item a border of _half_ the width of the supplied value. Since 1/2-pixel values don't render reliably across devices, the plugin enforces integer-pixel values for these "half"-borders. The default and minimum-allowed border-width is 2 pixels.
- Because each border is technically two separate "half"-borders that touch, some border-styles might not look like you'd expect them to, and this will be more noticeable with thicker borders. For this reason, I recommend sticking with solid borders, but feel free to experiment!

### The `none` value

Since this plugin relies on some gnarly CSS under the hood (including some negative margins and pseudo-elements), it comes with a `grid-inner-none` utility that "cancels" some of that CSS, in case you have to switch to some other kind of layout at a breakpoint. Here is what it does:

- On the grid-container, it sets `marginLeft: 0px` and `marginRight: 0px`. If you have need to override these margins, you'll find that a simple Tailwind class won't suffice, and you may need to bump the specificity (e.g., `lg:grid-inner-none lg:mx-4` won't work, but `lg:grid-inner-none lg:!mx-4` will).
- On the grid-items, it sets `margin: 0px`, `border-width: 0px`, `border-color: currentcolor`, `border-style: solid`, and `grid-column: auto`. Here too you'll find that simple Tailwind classes on the grid-items will lack the specificity to override these properties, and you may need to bump the specificity (like `lg:!m-4`).
- It sets the `::after` pseudo-element on the grid-items to `display: none`, and the same specificity-bump caveat applies here. What's more: if you try to _use_ the `::after` pseudo-element on a grid-item (at a breakpoint where `grid-inner-none` is in effect), you'll sometimes find that some CSS properties are already set on it, and that overriding them requires more specificity-bumps. So if the need arises, reach for `::before` instead.

Note that the grid-container will still have `display: grid`, `gap: 0`, and whatever `grid-template-columns` value is currently active. But _these_ properties can be overridden with simple Tailwind classes (like `lg:grid-inner-none lg:block` or `lg:grid-inner-none lg:grid-cols-4 lg:gap-4`).

Finally, note that the specificity required to override the `grid-inner-none` styles on the grid-items will depend on whether you've configured the plugin with the `target: 'legacy'` option.
